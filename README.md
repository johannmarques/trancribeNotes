Using video transcription for generating class notes

I downloaded a bunch os lectures videos. I may not have time to watch and write my own notes for each one. So I decided I would get lecture transcriptions and use them as inputs for generating well-summarised notes using ChatGPT.

At the moment, I only have the transcriptions. I'm currently working on training ChatGPT for generating the notes.
